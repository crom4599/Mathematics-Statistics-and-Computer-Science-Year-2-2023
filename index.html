							Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science (MSCS) is a Discipline of its own in the School of Natural and Physical Sciences (SNPS) at the University of Papua New Guinea.<br> As the 	name of the discipline stands, the course deals with mathematics, statistics and computer science.<br>
							As a second year MSCS student, I am required to take four(4) courses; <i>Calculus 1, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics and Information and Comunication Concept (ICT).</i> 
							All the four courses mentioned above belong to the MSCS Discipline.
						</p>
						<p style="font-family:sans-serif; ">
							Information Technology Concept (ITC) is the only course apart from the other three that deals with computer, the other three are mathematics courses. ITC mostly deals with <strong>introduction to computers</strong>; <i> Introduction to computer hardwares and softwares, binary numbers, creation of webpages and many other amazing stuff.</i><br>
